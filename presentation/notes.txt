Hello everyone, I'm Pedro Paulo. I'm an undergraduate student from the University of São Paulo and today, I'll be presenting this paper: A Survey on the Mathematical Emphasis in Computer Science Curricula.

=================================================

This paper has the following outline:

 - First, I'd like to present you a broad view of current enducation trends applied to CS education
 
   It will also be important to note how mathematics has already been loosing space in CS in terms of standard curricula
   
 - Second, in the Methodology and Data parts, I am going to present the study developed in this work. This case study analyzes the mathematical focus in eleven well ranked CS programs in Brazil.
 
 - Finally, in the final block of this presentation, I'll draw some conclusions and interpret if math is actually loosing space
 

Before I start, I'd like to briefly introduce you to my motivation for this work:
 - I am part of a committee of faculty plus students responsible to reform the current Computer Science curriculum of the CS Department of the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, which I am part.
 - Is a common complain among students, the high load of math in the curriculum
 - The faculty is interested in finding how different is the IME/USP CS curriculum compared other curricula that is used in different CS programs across Brazil.

=================================================

Starting the Introduction block of the presentation, here are two different, and often complimentary trends that are present in CS education.

The first trend may be called a "Technical" trend, as it has a greater interest on tackling the current problems of society. Its focus on applying the technical knowledge to solve those problems has a consequence of helping the immediate employability of a student.

The second trend may be known as an "Academic" trend. This one also has a focus on solving problems. The difference is that it applies a more abstract reasoning, glimpsing the future.

I'd like to stress on how there is no dicothomy between these two trends. Some courses in a same program may tend to have a technical focus while others may have an academical focus.

=================================================

Now, that being said, what is the common denominator of these two trends?

This quote from Max Blouw, president and vice-chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, is from the article "Universities should educate -- employers should train" summarizes with remarks of mine:

Universities are primarily in the business of positive human development.

They focus on enhancing the abilities of our graduates to communicate clearly and effectively, to analyze, to confront ambiguity with clear methods and confidence, to break down problems into manageable parts, to think critically and to question deeply.

=================================================

One may think that theoretical knowledge is of all importance, but let's not "drink the kool aid". This excerpt extracted from the CS2008 curriculum made by ACM and IEEE makes a point. Again, the remarks are mine.

A fundamental aspect of computer science is the balance between theory and practice and the essential link between them.

Graduates of a computer science program must understand not only the theoretical underpinnings of the discipline but also how that theory influences practice.

=================================================

Now in terms of mathematics, computer science has a deep connection with the field. As it may be noted, it connects and draws from many disciplines, some of which are described here.

That being said, the bibliography, for example the two papers described here note that since at least the 1960s the role of mathematics has been decrasing, although at a lower rate today.

=================================================

This leads us to the case study described in this work.

Here, we make a quantitative analysis of eleven well ranked Brazilian CS programs. The ranking will be detailed in the following slides.

The results are compared with two reference curricula, the CS2008 provided by a joint venture of the ACM with IEEE.

It is noteworthy that this case study is, as explained before, suitable for a curriculum reform.

Despite this, the case study does not account any focus given by a particular CS program, continuous or discrete math, for example.

=================================================

In terms of reference curricula, we adopted two diffeent sources:

One international, the Computer Science Curriculum 2008, provided by a joint taskforce of the ACM and IEEE Computer Society.

The other is national, the Currículo de Referência 2005, provided by the Brazilian Computer Society.

Speaking of the CS2008, it is divided into 14 Knowledge Areas like "Algoritms and Complexity", "Architecture and Organization" and "Discrete Structures".

The latter is the knowledge area of interest of this paper.
It is further subdivided in the following knowledge units: 
Functions, Relations and Sets, Basic Logic, Proof Techniques, Basics of Counting, Graphs and Trees, Discrete Probability.

From this list of topics, Graphs and Trees were excluded from being accounted since it is difficult differentiate graphs courses that have a mathematical focus from courses that have an algorithmic focus.

Also, advanced mathematics such as calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra were not accounted. The work assumes that students have acquired the needed mathematical background elsewhere. 

About the CR2005, it is divided in 6 areas like Mathematics, Computing Fundamentals, Computing Technologies, etc.

=================================================

The definition of what is mathematics is well suited to this paper since it represents all the topics usually seen in a CS program.

These topics are described here:

Calculus
Linear Algebra
Geometry
Set Theory
Algebra
Discrete mathematics
Probability
Statistics

=================================================

Now I'd like to talk about the process of selection of the studied CS programs.

According to the Brazilian Ministry of Education, there are at least 354 CS programs. Of those, 258 private and 96 public.

The methodology for this ranking has the following process: 

The `Guia do Estudante' office contacts yearly all universities in Brazil to catalog all undergraduate programs that will be accepting new students for the next year.

Are considered for ranking programs that grant a bachelor's degree, are at least two years old and are in-class. After this step, the office contacts the courses coordinators in order to ask them to fulfill an online questionnaire containing 15 specific questions about the program.

Among the topics covered are themes relative to the faculty, scientific production and physical installations. The questionnaires are not graded, only are made available to a group of peer reviewers to help in their grading process.

Even if a program does not fulfill the questionnaire it will be graded.

The survey has a group of peer reviewers composed of course coordinators, directors of departments and teachers. They are responsible for evaluating the programs on a scale ranging from 5 (excellent) to 1 (poor) and ``prefer not to opine''.

Each peer reviewer assesses a maximum of 30 randomly chosen programs, preferably in the region where he teaches and excluded those programs from his institution. Each program receives grades from six consultants, the best and worst being excluded.

The final score is the average of the four intermediate ones. The process has technical consultancy from Ibope Inteligência and is audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

=================================================

In the map of Brazil we can see the geographical distribution of the selected CS programs.

Most of them are in the coast, as it is where most of the Brazilian population live.

The southeast, being the wealthiest of the regions of Brazil concentrates 5 of the 11 programs, 3 other programs are in the south and 3 in the northeast.

=================================================

This first table presents some basic information on the programs researched.

Here we can see how there is a concentration of public universities in the ranking, partially because of the prestige that those instiutions have in Brazil.

Also, all universities are

Thank you for you presence!

As a last reminder, I'd like to thank both the Ensinar com Pesquisa and the Pro-Int grants from the Universty of São Paulo. I would't be here without their support.

Now, this presentation was a bit shorter than normal in order to open space to a discussion on your experience as faculty in many different technological programs.

For instance, do you feel that math is being useful to your students?

Do they retain the knowledge after a period of time or you have to review some concept previously taught in order to use it in a more advanced course?
