\begin{quote}
Universities are primarily in the business of positive human development. They
focus on enhancing the abilities of our graduates to \textbf{communicate clearly
and effectively}, to \textbf{analyze}, to \textbf{confront ambiguity} with clear methods and
confidence, to \textbf{break down problems} into manageable parts, to \textbf{think critically}
and to \textbf{question deeply}.\\

The technology area is a strong example on how \textbf{standard procedures} inside the
industry are \textbf{constantly changing}.

\begin{block}{Challenges}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item How can the university enable one to reason when facing new
		problems?
		\item How \emph{perennial}, fundamental should be the concepts taught?

\frametitle{The interplay between theory and practice}
\begin{quote}
A fundamental aspect of computer science is the \textbf{balance between theory and
practice and the essential link between them}. Graduates of a computer science
program must understand not only the theoretical underpinnings of the discipline
but also how that \textbf{theory influences practice}. \\

\frametitle{Decreasing focus on mathematics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CS is a broad field that connects to and draws from many disciplines, 
	including mathematics, electrical engineering, psychology, statistics, fine 
	arts, linguistics, and physical and life sciences.
	\item The role of mathematics in reference curricula has been decreasing
	gradually since at least the 1960s, although at a lower rate today.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Brazil has more than 350 different CS programs
	\item The eleven selected ones were ranked as 5-stars by the \emph{Guia do
	Estudante} ranking. 
	\item The ranking consists of an opinion poll among professors, course
	coordinators and directors of departments.
	\item Each program is graded by six different reviewers, extremes are excluded
	\item Ranking audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers

\section{Conclusions}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reapply the analysis with other rankings (Eg. ENADE ranking made
	by the Brazilian Ministry of Education)
	\item Is there any correlation between being well ranked and the amount of
	math studied?
	\item How useful was mathematics after graduation? Apply questionnaires to
	analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a curriculum.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{This paper}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyzed the different perspectives of teaching at universities and 
	opinions related
	\item Noted the decline of the teaching of mathematics in CS both as a trend
	in reference curricula and in eleven different CS programs in Brazil
\end{itemize}
